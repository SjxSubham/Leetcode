### Approach
<!-- Describe the algorithm, data structures used, and time/space complexity. -->
<!-- Explain step-by-step how your solution works and its complexity. -->


### Intuition
<!-- Explain the core idea behind your approach. -->
<!-- Why does this approach work? What insights led you to it? -->


### Solution in C++
<!-- Paste your C++ solution code. Ensure it compiles and passes sample tests. -->

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Your solution code here
};
```
